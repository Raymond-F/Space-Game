DERELICT
No surprises here - on closer examination this turns out to be the wreckage of something that once could have been called a ship. Now, it simply exists as a tangled mess of shattered hull and vented rooms. Whatever happened here, the remains are yours to pick at, should you choose to.
OPTION
Excellent.
EXIT

AMBUSH
As you pull in closer your attention is drawn away from the wreckage to the sudden sound of an alarm going off on the bridge. Another ship has been detected, and it's closing fast! You quickly order the crew to battle stations and prepare yourself for a fight.
OPTION
To arms!

NOTHING
No surprises here - on closer examination this turns out to be the wreckage of something that once could have been called a ship. Vacuum, collisions, and more than likely other scavenger teams appear to have done a number on this wreck. Even with your relatively cursory examination, you determine that there's nothing worth salvaging here.
OPTION
Let's move on.

END
You decide whatever this junkheap is isn't worth your time. You pull away and it soon drifts out of sensor range.
OPTION
Better safe than sorry.
