DERELICT
No surprises here - on closer examination this turns out to be the wreckage of something that once could have been called a ship. Now, it simply exists as a tangled mess of shattered hull and vented rooms. Whatever happened here, the remains are yours to pick at, should you choose to.
OPTION
Excellent.

NOTHING
No surprises here - on closer examination this turns out to be the wreckage of something that once could have been called a ship. Vacuum, collisions, and more than likely other scavenger teams appear to have done a number on this wreck. Even with your relatively cursory examination, you determine that there's nothing worth salvaging here.
OPTION
Let's move on.

END
You decide whatever this junkheap is isn't worth your time. You pull away and it soon drifts out of sensor range.
OPTION
Better safe than sorry.
