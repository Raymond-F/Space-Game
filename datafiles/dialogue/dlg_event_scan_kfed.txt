START
As you drift slowly through the void waiting for your drive to cycle for another jump, you're hailed by an approaching ship. After a short delay you bring their comms officer on screen. #"Attention unidentified vessel! Present your credentials and submit to a cargo scan immediately, or you will be fired upon." The officer giving the declaration does not even meet your eyes, although you know they can see you on their side of the comms panel.

You quickly order the bridge crew to send over any pertinent credentials and drift in silence as the soft chirp of some device somewhere lets you know they've begun their scan...
OPTION
[Wait]

ASK
The officer rolls their eyes ever-so-subtly. #"Federation Statue KF-921.92 states that all vessels within Federation space are subject to checks, scans, and searches at the discretion of any acting naval officer. You are currently within Federation space. Now send the credentials. Captain." #He waits expectantly.
OPTION
I see.
$START

RESIST
The man on screen frowns and he seems to listen to someone offscreen give a command. #"This is your final warning. Submit to a scan or you will be fired upon."
